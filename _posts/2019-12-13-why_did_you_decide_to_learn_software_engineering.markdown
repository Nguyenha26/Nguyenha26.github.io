Over a year ago, members from a company called “Bitwise” came to the charter school that I am currently teaching at. Their goal was to spread awareness and get involvement from the community about coding or the field of Software Engineering. They wanted to build a partnership with our school and provide a program for our students. Before they came, I wasn’t familiar with what coding was. However, that all changed after presenting their bit about coding and how amazing the field was. 

On that very day, they were able to reach their goal with one community member: ME. In addition to becoming aware of coding, they were able to also peaked my interest in getting involved with Software Engineering. They had mentioned that they offered adult beginner courses to code at their Bitwise stadium. I decided to join the course and was taught the basics of HTML & CSS. Even though it was a brief 6-week course, I knew in that moment that it was something I would enjoy doing as a career. Coding felt like a puzzle and it was my job to put the pieces together to form a beautiful picture. As I continue to research about the field, I begin to fall in love with it even more. Not only do I eventually get to reap wonderful benefits such as high pay and remote work; I am excited to be part of a field that will consistently challenge me.
